Reflecting on the previous work, it’s important to consider how ethics and inequity play a role in working with data. For instance, when we collect and use customer data to analyze their spending habits or visits to the market, we need to ensure that we're being transparent about how that data is used. Customers should know what is being tracked, why it’s being tracked, and how it benefits them. Privacy is key, and businesses should make sure customer information is handled securely and only used for legitimate purposes. This would ensure that customers' trust is maintained, and their personal data isn't misused.

In general, when working with data, we need to think about the potential impact of our decisions. We are telling stories, and we need to consider that each piece of data reflects and impacts real world scenarios.
